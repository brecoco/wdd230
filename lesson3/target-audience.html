                <p class="box-p">This site is directed to people who are interested in knowing 
                    more about the temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints 
                    located in Brazil. It is a site where you can find information such as photos, 
                    address, construction date, operating status. The temples of the LDS Church 
                    are beautiful constructions that draw attention and arouse curiosity of many people. 
                    Brazil in recent years has gained several temples and that's why the importance 
                    of building a website with centralized information about Brazilian temples.</p>
