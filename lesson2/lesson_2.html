                    Sales pages, especially those with a wide variety of products, 
                    need to make good use of the space they have to present many things 
                    to customers in a clear and direct way. For this, it is necessary 
                    that the information is well distributed on the screen, making use 
                    of the blank space to not leave the page polluted in such a way that 
                    the customer does not understand what is being shown or that he misses 
                    something that he could have taken advantage of but not did it because 
                    he hadn't seen it.

                    Product sales page, mainly similar products, I believe they are 
                    the ones that most need repetition. Products need to be arranged 
                    in such a way that everything is easy to see: name, color, sizes, 
                    style, price. These characteristics are repeated in all products 
                    on the page. I took the Nike website as an example, where in the 
                    selection of sneakers we can clearly see the photo of the sneakers, 
                    availability, model name, genre, number of colors and price, 
                    and all this repeating for each item.

                    <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures?lang=eng&platform=web" target="_blank">LDS Library</a><br>
                    <img src="../images/alignment.png" alt="lds.org"><br>
                    The church library page for me is a good example of item alignment 
                    and organization. The alignment of the items is very well done, 
                    leaving the appearance pleasant and easy to navigate. 
                    Items are properly sized for easy selection.
